# Quality Gate Decision for Story 3.3
schema: 1
story: "3.3"
story_title: "Implement Monitor Command with Real-Time Display"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Critical issues resolved: monitorCommand now uses StreamService.subscribeToCollection(), integration tests added, README updated, and all ACs met."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

waiver: { active: false }

top_issues:
  - id: "IMPL-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "monitorCommand.js calls streamService.onItemSold(), onItemListed(), onItemTransferred(), onItemReceivedBid(), onItemCancelled() which do not exist in StreamService"
    suggested_action: "Refactor monitorCommand to use streamService.subscribeToCollection() with event type arrays instead of non-existent convenience methods"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Unit tests only verify command structure but do not test actual functionality or integration with services"
    suggested_action: "Add integration tests that mock StreamService and NotificationService to verify the command actually works"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "DOC-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Story Dev Notes incorrectly document StreamService API - mentions onItemSold() methods that don't exist"
    suggested_action: "Update Dev Notes to reflect actual StreamService API (subscribeToCollection method)"
