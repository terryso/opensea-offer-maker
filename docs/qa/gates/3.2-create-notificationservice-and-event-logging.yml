nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Service handles data safely with proper error handling. Event logs contain no sensitive information."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient file I/O with append-only writes. Log rotation prevents unbounded growth. Query operations properly filtered."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent error handling with graceful degradation. File operations don't crash service on failure. Malformed JSON handled properly."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization with clear separation of concerns. Comprehensive JSDoc documentation. Helper methods appropriately extracted."

test_architecture:
  coverage:
    statements: 89.21%
    branches: 67.72%
    functions: 100%
    lines: 88.88%
  quality: "Excellent - comprehensive mocking, AAA pattern, edge cases covered"
  test_count: 66
  uncovered_areas:
    - "Lines 163-165, 202-204, 242-244, 280-282 (detailed verbosity formatting - low risk)"
    - "Lines 491-492 (empty file deletion edge case - low risk)"
    - "Lines 549-564 (event-specific transform branches - tested via integration paths)"

code_quality:
  architecture: "Excellent - follows established service patterns"
  consistency: "Excellent - matches StreamService and other service implementations"
  documentation: "Excellent - comprehensive JSDoc with usage examples"
  error_handling: "Excellent - graceful degradation, no crashes on failures"
  standards_compliance: "Excellent - uses logger throughout, proper BigInt handling, correct imports"

      priority: low

strengths:
  - "Comprehensive test coverage exceeding requirements (89% vs 80% target)"
  - "All 5 event types properly formatted with 3 verbosity levels"
  - "Robust error handling with graceful degradation strategy"
  - "Excellent use of helper methods for code reusability"
  - "Proper file system operations with directory creation"
  - "Standardized JSONL log format for easy parsing"
  - "Flexible query system with multiple filter options"
  - "Log rotation with both file-level and line-level cleanup"
  - "Proper use of logger utility throughout (no console.log)"
  - "Well-structured tests using AAA pattern with comprehensive mocking"
