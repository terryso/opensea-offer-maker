## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Analysis of existing keyManager.js implementation and security best practices]

**Current KeyManager Security Issues Identified:**
- Hardcoded encryption parameters in source code create security vulnerability
- No key strength validation for user-provided private keys
- Missing protection against brute force decryption attempts
- No secure memory cleanup for sensitive key material
- Limited error handling that doesn't prevent information leakage

**Learning from Security Audits:**
- Encryption keys should never be hardcoded in source code
- Key derivation functions should use configurable, memory-hard algorithms
- Sensitive data should be cleared from memory as soon as possible
- Error messages should not reveal information about encryption parameters
- Migration strategies are essential for security upgrades to avoid data loss

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, Node.js crypto module documentation]

**Runtime & Security:**
- Node.js 16+ with ES Modules support
- Native `crypto` module for cryptographic operations
- `scrypt` key derivation function for memory-hard key derivation
- `aes-256-gcm` authenticated encryption for confidentiality and integrity

**Dependencies:**
- No new npm dependencies required
- Uses built-in Node.js crypto API
- `ethers.js` v6+ for wallet operations (already in project)

**Security Requirements:**
- Minimum 256-bit encryption keys
- Memory-hard key derivation with configurable parameters
- Authenticated encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- Secure random number generation for IV/salt generation

### KeyManager Implementation Pattern
[Source: Current keyManager.js analysis and Node.js crypto best practices]

**Current Implementation Structure:**
```javascript
// Current problematic code (to be replaced)
export const SALT = Buffer.from('opensea-offer-maker-salt', 'utf8');
export const PASSWORD = 'opensea-offer-maker-password';
export const ENCRYPTION_KEY = scryptSync(PASSWORD, SALT, 32);
```

**New Secure Implementation Pattern:**
```javascript
// New secure implementation
import { scryptSync, randomBytes, createCipheriv, createDecipheriv } from 'crypto';

export class KeyManager {
  static deriveKey(password, salt, options = {}) {
    const {
      iterations = 32768,
      blockSize = 8,
      parallelism = 1,
      keyLength = 32
    } = options;

    return scryptSync(password, salt, keyLength, {
      N: iterations,
      r: blockSize,
      p: parallelism,
      maxmem: 128 * 1024 * 1024 // 128MB limit
    });
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, environment variable patterns]

**Required New Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Encryption Configuration
ENCRYPTION_SALT=your-custom-salt-minimum-16-chars
ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=your-strong-password-minimum-32-chars
ENCRYPTION_ITERATIONS=32768
ENCRYPTION_MEMORY=134217728  # 128MB in bytes
ENCRYPTION_PARALLELISM=1
```

**Configuration Validation Rules:**
- `ENCRYPTION_SALT`: Minimum 16 characters, recommended 32+ characters
- `ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`: Minimum 32 characters, high entropy recommended
- `ENCRYPTION_ITERATIONS`: Minimum 16384, recommended 32768+ for production
- `ENCRYPTION_MEMORY`: Minimum 64MB, recommended 128MB+
- `ENCRYPTION_PARALLELISM`: Typically 1, increase for multi-core systems

### Security Enhancement Requirements
[Source: Security best practices for cryptographic key management]

**Key Strength Validation:**
```javascript
function validatePrivateKey(privateKey) {
  // Check format (0x prefix + 64 hex characters)
  if (!privateKey.startsWith('0x') || privateKey.length !== 66) {
    throw new Error('Invalid private key format');
  }

  // Check entropy (avoid weak keys)
  const keyBytes = Buffer.from(privateKey.slice(2), 'hex');
  const entropy = calculateEntropy(keyBytes);
  if (entropy < 7.0) { // High entropy threshold
    throw new Error('Private key appears to have insufficient entropy');
  }

  // Validate with ethers.js
  try {
    new ethers.Wallet(privateKey);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Invalid private key: ' + error.message);
  }
}
```

**Decryption Attempt Limiting:**
```javascript
class DecryptionAttemptLimiter {
  constructor(maxAttempts = 5, lockoutDuration = 300000) { // 5 minutes
    this.attempts = new Map();
    this.maxAttempts = maxAttempts;
    this.lockoutDuration = lockoutDuration;
  }

  checkAttempts(identifier) {
    const now = Date.now();
    const attempts = this.attempts.get(identifier) || [];

    // Clean old attempts
    const recent = attempts.filter(time => now - time < this.lockoutDuration);

    if (recent.length >= this.maxAttempts) {
      const lockoutRemaining = Math.ceil((this.lockoutDuration - (now - recent[0])) / 1000);
      throw new Error(`Too many decryption attempts. Try again in ${lockoutRemaining} seconds.`);
    }

    recent.push(now);
    this.attempts.set(identifier, recent);
  }
}
```

### Migration Strategy Implementation
[Source: Analysis of existing key file format and backward compatibility requirements]

**Current Key File Format:**
```json
{
  "default": {
    "encryptedKey": "hex-encoded-encrypted-data",
    "iv": "hex-encoded-iv",
    "authTag": "hex-encoded-auth-tag",
    "isActive": true,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**New Key File Format (with versioning):**
```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "encryptionParams": {
    "algorithm": "aes-256-gcm",
    "keyDerivation": "scrypt",
    "iterations": 32768,
    "memory": 134217728,
    "parallelism": 1
  },
  "keys": {
    "default": {
      "encryptedKey": "hex-encoded-encrypted-data",
      "salt": "hex-encoded-salt",
      "iv": "hex-encoded-iv",
      "authTag": "hex-encoded-auth-tag",
      "isActive": true,
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**Migration Process:**
1. Detect old format (no `version` field)
2. Backup existing key file
3. Decrypt keys using old hardcoded parameters
4. Re-encrypt using new environment-based parameters
5. Update file format to version 2.0
6. Verify migrated keys can be decrypted successfully
7. Clean up backup after successful migration

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, error handling patterns]

**Security-Conscious Error Messages:**
- Never reveal encryption parameters or key material in error messages
- Provide generic error messages for decryption failures
- Log detailed errors for debugging while keeping user messages generic
- Implement structured error types for different failure scenarios

**Error Recovery Patterns:**
```javascript
// Generic error for users
try {
  const privateKey = await keyManager.decryptKey();
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof DecryptionError) {
    logger.error('Failed to decrypt private key. Please check your encryption configuration.');
    process.exit(1);
  }
  throw error; // Re-throw unexpected errors
}

// Detailed error for logging
logger.debug('Decryption failed', {
  error: error.message,
  keyId: 'default',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

### Performance Considerations
[Source: Node.js crypto performance best practices]

**scrypt Parameter Tuning:**
- Balance security vs performance based on user environment
- Provide preset configurations (low, medium, high security)
- Allow users to customize based on their hardware capabilities
- Monitor and log encryption operation times

**Memory Management:**
- Clear sensitive data from memory immediately after use
- Use Buffer.fill(0) for secure memory clearing
- Monitor memory usage during bulk operations
- Implement memory pooling for frequent operations
