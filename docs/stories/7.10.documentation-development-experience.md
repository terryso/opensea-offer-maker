## Dev Notes

### Current Documentation Analysis
[Source: Analysis of existing documentation and developer experience gaps]

**Current Documentation Status:**
- Basic README with installation and usage
- Limited API documentation and code comments
- No developer contribution guidelines
- Missing architecture documentation
- Limited troubleshooting resources
- No development tooling or automation

### Documentation Strategy Enhancement
[Source: Enterprise documentation best practices and developer experience design]

**Comprehensive Documentation Approach:**
- User-focused documentation for end users
- Developer-focused documentation for contributors
- Architecture documentation for system understanding
- API documentation for integration
- Troubleshooting documentation for support
