# Story 3.1: Integrate OpenSea Stream SDK and Create StreamService

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** CLI tool user,
**I want** a StreamService that manages WebSocket connections to the OpenSea Stream API,
**so that** the monitor command can receive real-time NFT events for my wallet

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `@opensea/stream-js` npm package is added to package.json dependencies
2. StreamService is created in `src/services/streamService.js` following existing service patterns

4. Subscription methods are implemented for all event types (item_listed, item_sold, item_transferred, item_received_bid, item_cancelled)
5. Collection-specific and wildcard (*) subscriptions are supported
6. Connection errors are handled gracefully with reconnection logic using exponential backoff
7. Event filtering by wallet address is implemented (events may include other wallets)
8. Graceful shutdown is implemented to cleanly close WebSocket connections
9. Unit tests are added for StreamService with mocked WebSocket connection (>80% coverage)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist in this project. This is the first story being developed.

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Required Dependency:**
- `@opensea/stream-js` - OpenSea Stream API SDK (to be added)
- `ws` - WebSocket library for Node.js (likely already available as transitive dependency)

**Existing Stack to Use:**
- Node.js 16+ with ES Modules support
- JavaScript ES2022
- Native fetch API for any HTTP calls
- Environment variables via `src/utils/env.js` or `src/config.js`

### Service Layer Pattern
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md, docs/architecture/components.md]

StreamService follows the existing service pattern established by OpenSeaApi, ReservoirApi, OfferService:

**Service Responsibilities:**
- Encapsulate external API/SDK interactions
- Implement business logic
- Provide reusable service interfaces
- Decouple from CLI framework

**File Location:** `src/services/streamService.js`

**Class Structure:**
```javascript
// Follow pattern from OpenSeaApi (src/services/openseaApi.js)
import logger from '../utils/logger.js';
import { OpenSeaStreamClient } from '@opensea/stream-js';
import WebSocket from 'ws';

export class StreamService {
  constructor(config) {
    this.config = config;
    // Initialize client
  }

  async connect() {
    // WebSocket connection logic
  }

  async subscribeToCollection(collectionSlug, eventTypes, callback) {
    // Subscription logic
  }

  async disconnect() {
    // Graceful shutdown
  }
}

export default StreamService;
```

### OpenSea Stream API Integration
[Source: docs/prd/epic-3-nft-monitoring.md#OpenSea Stream API Research]

**SDK Initialization:**
```javascript
import { OpenSeaStreamClient } from '@opensea/stream-js';
import { WebSocket } from 'ws';

const client = new OpenSeaStreamClient({
  token: process.env.OPENSEA_API_KEY,
  network: 'mainnet', // or 'testnet' for Sepolia
  connectOptions: {
    transport: WebSocket
  }
});
```

**Event Types:**
- `item_listed` - NFT is listed for sale
- `item_sold` - NFT is sold
- `item_transferred` - NFT ownership transferred
- `item_received_bid` - NFT receives a new bid/offer
- `item_cancelled` - Listing or bid is cancelled
- `item_metadata_updated` - NFT metadata changes (optional for this story)

**Subscription Methods:**
```javascript
// Subscribe to specific collection
client.onItemListed('collection-slug', (event) => {
  console.log(event);
});

// Subscribe to all collections (wildcard)
client.onItemSold('*', (event) => {
  console.log(event);
});

// Multiple event types
client.onEvents('collection-slug',
  ['item_listed', 'item_sold', 'item_transferred'],
  (event) => {
    console.log(event);
  }
);
```

**Event Payload Structure:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "item_sold",
  "event_timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "payload": {
    "item": {
      "nft_id": "ethereum/0x.../123",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "NFT Name",
        "image_url": "https://..."
      }
    },
    "collection": {
      "slug": "collection-slug"
    },
    "sale_price": "1000000000000000000",
    "from_account": {
      "address": "0x..."
    },
    "to_account": {
      "address": "0x..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Considerations:**
- Events may arrive out of order - use `event_timestamp` for sorting if needed
- Best-effort delivery - missed events during disconnection are not re-sent
- Authentication requires valid OpenSea API key
- Events include all activity - filter by wallet address on client side
- Network support: Mainnet (ethereum, polygon, etc.) and Testnet (Sepolia)

### Coding Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**CRITICAL Rules:**
1. **Logging:** Use `logger.info/debug/error()` from `src/utils/logger.js` - NEVER use `console.log`
   ```javascript
   import logger from '../utils/logger.js';
   logger.info('StreamService initialized');
   logger.debug('Event received:', event);
   logger.error('Connection failed:', error);
   ```

2. **Error Handling:** Catch errors and log with `logger.error()`, then throw or handle appropriately
   ```javascript
   try {
     await client.connect();
   } catch (error) {
     logger.error('Failed to connect to OpenSea Stream API:', error.message);
     throw error;
   }
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:** Access via `src/utils/env.js` or `src/config.js` - not directly via `process.env`
   ```javascript
   import { OPENSEA_API_KEY } from '../utils/env.js';
   ```

4. **API Keys:** Never hardcode API keys, always load from environment

5. **File Naming:** Use camelCase for service files: `streamService.js`

6. **Class Naming:** Use PascalCase: `class StreamService`

7. **Function Naming:** Use camelCase: `subscribeToCollection()`

8. **Private Methods:** Use `_` prefix: `_handleReconnection()` (not strictly enforced)

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/error-handling.md]

**Service Layer Error Pattern:**
```javascript
async doSomething() {
  try {
    const data = await externalApi.fetch();
    return processData(data);
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Service error:', error);
    throw error;  // Propagate to caller
  }
}
```

**Reconnection Strategy:**
- Implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Max delay configurable via `MONITOR_RECONNECT_MAX_DELAY` env var (default 60000ms)
- Log reconnection attempts with logger.info()
- Log connection errors with logger.error()

**WebSocket Error Handling:**
- Listen for 'error' events from WebSocket
- Log errors with context
- Trigger reconnection logic on connection failures
- Provide clear error messages to users

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/testing.md]

**Test File Location:** `src/__tests__/streamService.test.js`

**Test Framework:** Jest ^29.7.0

**Run Commands:**
```bash
npm test                    # Run unit tests
npm run test:coverage       # With coverage report
npm run test:watch          # Watch mode
```

**Mocking Strategy:**
- Mock `@opensea/stream-js` OpenSeaStreamClient
- Mock `ws` WebSocket
- Mock `src/utils/logger.js`
- Do NOT make real WebSocket connections in unit tests

**Test Structure (AAA Pattern):**
```javascript
describe('StreamService', () => {
  let service;
  let mockClient;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Arrange: Setup mocks
    mockClient = {
      onEvents: jest.fn(),
      connect: jest.fn(),
      disconnect: jest.fn()
    };
    jest.mock('@opensea/stream-js', () => ({
      OpenSeaStreamClient: jest.fn(() => mockClient)
    }));

    service = new StreamService({ apiKey: 'test-key', network: 'mainnet' });
  });

  describe('subscribeToCollection', () => {
    it('should subscribe to collection events', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const callback = jest.fn();

      // Act
      await service.subscribeToCollection('azuki', ['item_sold'], callback);

      // Assert
      expect(mockClient.onEvents).toHaveBeenCalledWith('azuki', ['item_sold'], expect.any(Function));
    });

    it('should filter events by wallet address', async () => {
      // Test event filtering logic
    });
  });

  describe('reconnection', () => {
    it('should retry with exponential backoff on connection failure', async () => {
      // Test reconnection logic
    });
  });
});
```

**Coverage Requirements:**
- Target: >80% coverage (lines, branches, functions, statements)
- Run `npm run test:coverage` to verify
- All public methods must be tested
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Test reconnection logic with various failure scenarios

**ES Modules Note:**
Jest requires `--experimental-vm-modules` flag (already configured in package.json scripts)

### Environment Variables
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, docs/prd/epic-3-nft-monitoring.md]

**Required:**
- `OPENSEA_API_KEY` - OpenSea API key for Stream API authentication (already exists in project)

**Optional (New):**
- `MONITOR_RECONNECT_MAX_DELAY` - Maximum reconnection delay in milliseconds (default: 60000)

**Access Pattern:**
```javascript
// Correct: Via env.js
import { OPENSEA_API_KEY } from '../utils/env.js';

// Incorrect: Direct access
const apiKey = process.env.OPENSEA_API_KEY;  // Don't do this
```

- `src/__tests__/streamService.test.js` - Unit tests

**Modified Files:**
- `package.json` - Add @opensea/stream-js dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated by npm install

**Dependency Hierarchy:**
```
Commands (to be added in future story)

- Use Jest framework with ES Modules support
- Mock all external dependencies (@opensea/stream-js, ws, logger)
- Target >80% code coverage
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

**Key Test Cases:**
1. Constructor initialization with correct config
2. Subscription to collection with specific event types
3. Wildcard subscription to all collections
4. Event filtering by wallet address (relevant events pass, others filtered)
5. Reconnection logic with exponential backoff
6. Graceful shutdown closes connections cleanly
7. Error handling for subscription failures
8. Error handling for connection failures

**Integration Tests:**
- NOT required for this story (integration tests are disabled in CI)
- Future story may add integration tests with real OpenSea Stream API

**Run Commands:**
```bash
npm test                          # Run unit tests (excludes integration)
npm run test:coverage             # Run with coverage report
npm run test:watch                # Watch mode for development
```

**Mocking Example:**
```javascript
jest.mock('@opensea/stream-js', () => ({
  OpenSeaStreamClient: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
    onEvents: jest.fn(),
    onItemListed: jest.fn(),
    onItemSold: jest.fn(),
    // ... other methods
  }))
}));

jest.mock('ws', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
    on: jest.fn(),
    close: jest.fn()
  }));
});
```

- Consistent naming and conventions

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage Quality: Excellent**

- **Test Count**: 46 comprehensive test cases
- **Coverage Metrics**: 88.23% lines, 91.48% branches, 100% functions (exceeds 80% target)
- **Test Organization**: Follows AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) consistently
- **Mock Strategy**: Appropriate mocking of @opensea/stream-js, ws, logger, env
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive coverage of error conditions, reconnection, filtering, state transitions

**Test Levels:**
- ✓ Unit tests: Excellent (all public methods tested with mocks)
- ○ Integration tests: Not required for this story (CI disabled)
- ○ E2E tests: Not applicable (service layer)

**Uncovered Lines Analysis:**
- Lines 245-246: Unreachable catch block (disconnect errors unlikely with null checks) - LOW RISK
- Lines 274-275, 280-283: Guard clauses in filter logic (defensive code) - LOW RISK
- Line 330: Duplicate reconnection timer guard - LOW RISK
- Lines 351-356: Resubscription during reconnection - LOWEST PRIORITY (complex edge case)

**Recommendation**: Current coverage is excellent for production. Future integration test could validate reconnection with active subscriptions, but not required for this story.

### Files Modified During Review

**No files were modified during review.** Implementation is production-ready as delivered by the development team.

The following files were created by the Dev Agent:
- `src/services/streamService.js` (360 lines) - StreamService implementation
- `src/__tests__/streamService.test.js` (802 lines) - Comprehensive unit tests
- Modified: `package.json`, `package-lock.json` (dependency addition)

**Note to Dev Agent**: File List in Dev Agent Record section is already complete and accurate.
