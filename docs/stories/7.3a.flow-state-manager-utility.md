## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a reusable FlowStateManager utility class to handle interactive CLI flow state and navigation,
**so that** I can simplify complex user interaction flows with consistent state management and navigation patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Analysis of Story 7.1 and 7.2 completion]

**Learning from KeyManager Security Refactor (Story 7.1):**
- Proper error handling with custom error types is essential
- Environment variable configuration patterns should be followed
- Class-based utilities work well with existing architecture

**Learning from Error Handling Refactor (Story 7.2):**
- Consistent error messages across the codebase improve debugging
- Logger should be used instead of console.log for all error reporting
- Input validation should be comprehensive and defensive

### Technical Architecture Context

**FlowStateManager Design Pattern:**
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-system-refactoring.md#story-73-交互式挂单服务重构]

Based on the epic requirements, the FlowStateManager needs to handle:
- Interactive flow state machine for CLI navigation
- Step history and navigation stack management
- State persistence and recovery mechanisms
- Support for BACK, CANCEL, NEXT navigation signals

**State Machine Architecture:**
```javascript
export const FLOW_STEPS = {
  SELECT_COLLECTION: 'select-collection',
  SELECT_NFT: 'select-nft',
  SELECT_PRICING_METHOD: 'select-pricing-method',
  INPUT_PRICING_VALUE: 'input-pricing-value',
  CONFIRM: 'confirm',
  DONE: 'done',
  CANCELLED: 'cancelled'
};

export const TRANSITIONS = {
  [FLOW_STEPS.SELECT_COLLECTION]: [
    FLOW_STEPS.SELECT_NFT,
    FLOW_STEPS.CANCELLED
  ],
  [FLOW_STEPS.SELECT_NFT]: [
    FLOW_STEPS.SELECT_PRICING_METHOD,
    FLOW_STEPS.SELECT_COLLECTION, // Back
    FLOW_STEPS.CANCELLED
  ]
  // ... other transitions
};
```

### File Location and Structure
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**Target Location:** `src/utils/FlowStateManager.js`

The utils directory contains 6 utility classes:
- `keyManager.js` - Security and encryption
- `commandUtils.js` - Chain and wallet management
- `configManager.js` - Configuration persistence
- `logger.js` - Logging system
- `proxySetup.js` - Network proxy configuration

FlowStateManager should follow the same patterns as these utilities with:
- ES Module exports (export class, export default)
- Proper error handling with logger
- Constructor-based dependency injection if needed
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation

### Coding Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Requirements:**
- Use ES2022 with ES Modules (package.json has `"type": "module"`)
- Follow camelCase file naming (`FlowStateManager.js`)
- Use PascalCase for class names (`class FlowStateManager`)
- Use logger from `src/utils/logger.js` - never console.log
- Proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for public methods

**File Structure Pattern:**
```javascript
// src/utils/FlowStateManager.js
import logger from './logger.js';

export class FlowStateManager {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    // initialization
  }

  // public methods
}

export default FlowStateManager;
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/testing.md]

**Test File Location:** `src/__tests__/FlowStateManager.test.js`

**Testing Standards:**
- Use Jest framework with experimental VM modules
- Achieve >90% code coverage
- Mock external dependencies
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test all public methods and edge cases
- Test error conditions and validation

**Test Structure Example:**
```javascript
describe('FlowStateManager', () => {
  let flowManager;

  beforeEach(() => {
    flowManager = new FlowStateManager();
  });

  describe('transition', () => {
    it('should transition to valid state', () => {
      // test implementation
    });

    it('should throw on invalid transition', () => {
      // test implementation
    });
  });

  // other test blocks
});
```

**Jest Configuration:**
- Requires `--experimental-vm-modules` flag
- Test files in `src/__tests__/` directory
- Coverage reports generated to `coverage/` directory
- Mock all external dependencies

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**Dependencies and Imports:**
- Should import logger from `./logger.js` (sibling utility)
- Should not import from services layer (maintain dependency direction)
- Can import constants from `../constants/` if needed
- Should be importable by commands and services

**Integration Points:**
- Will be used by future InteractiveListingService (Story 7.3d)
- May be used by other commands requiring interactive flows
- Should be designed as a reusable utility across the application

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Runtime Requirements:**
- Node.js 16+ with ES Modules support
- Must work with existing Jest configuration
- Should not introduce new external dependencies
- Memory usage should be minimal for CLI context

**Performance Considerations:**
- State transitions should be O(1) operations
- History management should handle reasonable depth (10-20 steps)
- Context data should not include large objects
- Should clean up resources when flow completes or cancels
