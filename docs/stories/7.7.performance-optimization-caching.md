# Story 7.7: Performance Optimization and Caching Strategy

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** faster response times and reduced API calls through intelligent caching,
**so that** the application is more responsive and efficient while maintaining data accuracy

## Acceptance Criteria
1. API response caching system implemented with configurable TTL and cache invalidation
2. File operation batching implemented to reduce I/O overhead and improve performance
3. Request deduplication system to prevent duplicate API calls for same data
4. Performance monitoring and metrics collection implemented to track optimization effectiveness
5. Memory-efficient caching with automatic cleanup and size limits
6. Comprehensive performance tests created to validate optimization improvements
7. All existing functionality preserved with no breaking changes to user experience

## Dev Notes

### Performance Analysis Results
[Source: Analysis of current performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities]

**Current Performance Issues:**
- Repeated API calls for same data without caching
- Synchronous file operations blocking execution
- Memory inefficiencies in large dataset processing
- No performance monitoring or metrics collection
- Lack of request deduplication causing redundant operations

### Caching Strategy Design
[Source: Enterprise caching patterns and performance optimization best practices]

**Multi-Level Caching Architecture:**
- Memory cache for frequently accessed data
- File cache for persistent storage
- API response caching with intelligent invalidation
- Request deduplication for concurrent operations
