# Story 7.9: Dependency Updates and Maintenance - Modernize Technology Stack

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** all dependencies updated to their latest stable versions with security patches,
**so that** the application benefits from the latest features, performance improvements, and security fixes

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All npm dependencies updated to latest stable versions with compatibility verification
2. Security vulnerability scan performed and all critical issues resolved
3. Dependency compatibility matrix created and validated across all components
4. Automated dependency management workflow implemented for ongoing maintenance
5. Breaking change documentation and migration guides created for major updates
6. Comprehensive testing performed to ensure no functionality regression
7. Long-term dependency maintenance strategy established with regular update schedules

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Current Dependency Analysis
[Source: Analysis of package.json and npm audit results]

**Current Dependency Status:**
- Several dependencies with available updates
- Security vulnerabilities identified in some packages
- OpenSea SDK version may need compatibility verification
- Ethers.js v6 migration may require code changes
- Testing framework dependencies need updates for latest Node.js versions

### Dependency Update Strategy
[Source: Enterprise dependency management best practices and security guidelines]

**Phased Update Approach:**
- Phase 1: Security-critical updates
- Phase 2: Core functionality updates with compatibility testing
- Phase 3: Development tool updates and optimization
- Phase 4: Long-term maintenance and monitoring setup
